# Agriculture Analytics

This project performs data analytics on the Indian Agriculture dataset and displays the results in tables using React and Mantine.

## Overview

The application performs the following tasks:
1. Aggregates crop data to display the crop with maximum and minimum production for each year.
2. Calculates and displays the average yield and average cultivation area for each crop from 1950 to 2020.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **Mantine**: A React component library used for creating tables and other UI components.
- **Yarn**: A package manager for JavaScript.
